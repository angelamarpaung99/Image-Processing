# Image-Processing
Acquisition and Basic Image Operation using Python.

The image operations included in this program are:
1. Opening and saving image file
2. Doing sampling, quantization, dithering, and halftoning
3. Doing transformation of color space, RGB, HSV, and Grayscale
4. Doing zoom in operation, zoom out, flip, cut and paste, wrapping, rotation
5. Showing histogram gray scale, histrogram RGB per channel, and histogram equalization

Implementation in code is a jupyter notebook file that can be found in "Image Acquisition and Basic Operation.ipynb"
Image original file can be found in "coffee.png"
The rest image files are the result of the basic image operation.
